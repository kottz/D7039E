## Workflow

2. Write your section file.
3. If you have any figures or external files that are needed for the section create a folder name for example `<section_name>_fig`. For example `martin_introduction_fig`
4. Push your changes. 

### When you feel satisfied with your section
1. Go to the project repo on github.com
