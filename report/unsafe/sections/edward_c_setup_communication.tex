Unlike most servo motors controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals.
Dynamixel uses digital packet communication.
By grouping data into different packages and transmitting it as a bundle.
This in turn opens up for many possibilities since the motors responds to commands and have built in control functions you can execute together with memory allocation on the motor itself.
Dynamixel recommends two different setups for communication,
either by using a Tri-state-buffer to construct your own communication bridge and protocol based on Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter setup (UART) or by using their own built solution called U2D2.
In essense, the U2D2 uses the same protocol but also enables for USB communication between the controller and Dynamixels.
