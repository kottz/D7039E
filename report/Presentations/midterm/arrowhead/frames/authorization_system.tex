    Implements two methods
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Authorization control
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Sets up rules for which services are allowed to access each other.
            \item Specifies which protocols will be used for communication.
            \item Sets up rules for communication within local cloud, also called intracloud authorization.
            \item Sets up rules for communication with remote clouds, also called intercloud authorization.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Token generation
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Generates a token used for accessing services within cloud, currently only supported between remote clouds. 
                \item Will not be used in our implementation, we will use certificates.
            \end{itemize}
            
    \end{itemize}
