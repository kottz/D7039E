preliminary stuff
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since the base use tracks, it can turn on a point. Therefor the turning radius will be the length from the center of the tracks, to the object furthest away from the center.
    \item The acceleration need to be slow enough to not tip the robot over, since it seems quite top heavy.
    \item The motors will need decoders for some of the control to work, if done the way they're planed
    \item The motors also need to be strong enough to move the robot, both with and without load.
\end{itemize}
