%% Theory for arm kinematics and FK/IK
%%Kinematic equations
A robot arm is composed of a set of links connected by different joints.
 The kinematic equations represent the chains that connect the system toghther and their dependabilties. % crap re-write...


%%FK 
Forward kinematics cover the relationship between joints of the robot, in this case arm. 
With the orientation and postition of the end effector, claw.  %% rev till sponge.
By representing the kinematic chain in two different joint parameters that cover the relationship between the links.
$\theta$ represent the angle between two links and $d$ the dispalcement of a joint.
