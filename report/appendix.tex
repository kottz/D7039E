\section{Team members}

\subsection{Martin Blaszczyk}
Martin is a 5th year Y-student with interest in Control och Mechatronics. 
In this course he'll take the role of a Project Leader where the main objectives
are to keep focus on the goal, hold meetings and an overall oversight of the project. 
As for the technical part the main interest will be in machine vision together with
Edward K. to use cameras or other sensors to localize external objects for the 
robot to grip, avoid or approach. 

\subsection{Edward Cedgård}

\subsection{Niklas Dahlquist}
Niklas is studying his fifth year at the Engineering physics and electrical engineering student programe.

His main focus will be to work with Edward Cedgård to evaluate the gripping mechanism and if necessary design new components and model the corresponding control system to be able to lift up and hold the target object.

\subsection{Edward Källstedt}

\subsection{Albin Martinsson}
Albin is a 5th year computer science student specializing in industrial computer system. In this project he will be focusing on the 
arrowhead integration and be in charge of the github repository. This will entail connecting all the services to each other and
making sure they are authenticated and secure. Being in charge of the git repository will entail merging pull requests and sorting
out conflicts, making sure that the version control part of this project runs smoothly.

\subsection{Måns Norell}
As Måns is a control student, he will be working on the movement and navigation system for the robot. In the beginning this will manifest in moving the robot to user specified coordinates.
