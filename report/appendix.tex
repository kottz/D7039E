Edward main task is to design the grip mechanism with Niklas. Topics like
the design of the claw, nessesary components, model of the controlsystem and then implementation. 

\subsection{Niklas Dahlquist}

\subsection{Edward K채llstedt}

\subsection{Albin Martinsson}
Albin is a 5th year computer science student specializing in industrial computer system. In this project he will be focusing on the 
arrowhead integration and be in charge of the github repository. This will entail connecting all the services to each other and
making sure they are authenticated and secure. Being in charge of the git repository will entail merging pull requests and sorting
out conflicts, making sure that the version control part of this project runs smoothly.
