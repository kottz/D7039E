%% information about the different ways of communication (link back to discussion about why we switched to USB instead of TTL)



%general ttl communication,
Dynamixel Ax-12a uses half dublex serial communication. Meaning data can only go one direction at a time, by using the same dataline for transmitting and reciving data.
Microcontroller uses full duplex communication, both sending and reciving data at the same time. This results in a potential conflict between the controller and motors.
By using a tri-state-buffer one can convert the system to only half duplex. %förklara hur genom flowchart och förklaring. 



%usb interface

U2D2 is the standarized adapter created by Robotis to enable simple communication through USB and TTL, RS-485 or UART.
