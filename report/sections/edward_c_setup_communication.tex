%general ttl communication,
Dynamixel Ax-12a uses half dublex serial communication. Meaning data can only go one direction at a time, by using the same dataline for transmitting and reciving data.
Microcontroller uses full duplex communication, both sending and reciving data simultaneously. This results in a potential conflict between the controller and motors.
This can be solved  by using a tri-state-buffer circuit converting the system to half duplex.

%usb interface

U2D2 is the standarized adapter created by Robotis to enable simple communication through USB, TTL, RS-485 or UART.
