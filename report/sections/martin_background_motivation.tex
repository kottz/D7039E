% Short Arrowhead introduction
Arrowhead is an initiative from Luleå University of Technology to create a unifying framework which can enable embedded devices to intergrate and interoperate services in an open-network environment. This framework and its approach will strongly conribute to the reduction of design and engineering effeors with 75\% or more.

% Why project course?
As part of the Engineering Project course for Master students in Computer Science, Control and Electrical Engineering at Luleå University of Technology the goal is to implement and demonstrate how the Arrowhead Framework can be used in a factory setting using autonomous ground robots. This project report aims to give an example of a wheeled robot which can autonomously perform basic tasks in a factory using machine vision and instructions from the simulated factory management by implementing the Arrowhead framework. 

% Wait, there's more
Additionally because this is a project report we're also proposing methods on project structure and workflows using Git for simliar types of projects where a small group of people will collaborate.
