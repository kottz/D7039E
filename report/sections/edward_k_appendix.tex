\section*{Edward KÃ¤llstedt}
Currently studying his fourth year in the Master Programme in Computer Science and Engineering.
A fan of making things secure, fast, scalable, and well-documented. Primarily interested in
low level software development. Will initially work on the machine vision implementation 
together with Martin. In addition to machine vision specifically this work will also consist
of robot localization and collision avoidance. As the project progresses he will take on more
general software problems that might arise. The first week will be spent researching different
computer vision technologies.
